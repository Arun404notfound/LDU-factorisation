This is Introduction to Computers college project to make a LDU factorization calculator.
Prerequisites:-
  1.)It should be able to take dimensions as entry.
  2.) Based on dimensions it should take entries for elements of the matrix.
  3.) It should calculate LDU factorization showing each step and mentioning the arithmetic operations performed with row or columns at each step.
  4.) At last it should be able to show verification that on multiplying L*D*U it's giving us back the matrix which it took as input.
